/**
 * First-time defaults from the bundled controller database.
 *
 * A pad the database knows gets its mapping the moment it is first about to be mirrored, so it works
 * before the editor is ever opened. Seeding writes through [MappingRepository] like any user edit,
 * so the editor shows and adjusts it with nothing special-cased.
 *
 * A pad whose mapping the user emptied is indistinguishable from one never seen, so "Clear all" is
 * followed by a re-seed on the next mirror start. That is the intended meaning: clearing returns the
 * pad to its defaults, and for a known pad the database entry IS its default — a user who wants a
 * binding gone clears that one row, which leaves the mapping non-empty and therefore untouched.
